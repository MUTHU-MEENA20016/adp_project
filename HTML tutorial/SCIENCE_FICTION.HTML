        <H2>WHAT IS SCIENCE FICTION ?</H2>
        <P><FONT SIZE="5">Science fiction, popularly shortened as sci-fi, is a genre of fiction that creatively depicts real 
        or imaginary science and technology as part of its plot, setting, or theme.The word science refers to the fact that the
        story in some way involves science or technology that—no matter how advanced—is depicted as being based on real scientific
        principles, as opposed to involving magic or the supernatural.Science fiction isn’t always ultrafuturistic. Sometimes, 
        it depicts technology just beyond or slightly different than our own.</FONT></P>
