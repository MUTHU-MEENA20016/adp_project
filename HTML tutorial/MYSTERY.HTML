         <H2>WHAT IS A MYSTERY GENRE ?</H2>
        <P><FONT SIZE="5">The mystery genre is a genre of fiction that follows a crime (like a murder or a disappearance) from the moment
         it is committed to the moment it is solved. Mystery novels are often called “whodunnits” because they turn the
         reader into a detective trying to figure out the who, what, when, and how of a particular crime. Most mysteries 
         feature a detective or private eye solving a case as the central character.</FONT></P>
