        historical events.An essential element of historical fiction is that it is set in the past and pays attention to the
        manners, social conditions and other details of the depicted period.Authors also frequently choose to explore
        notable historical figures in these settings, allowing readers to better understand how these individuals might have
        responded to their environments. </FONT></P>
