        <H2>WHAT IS FANTASY?</H2>
        <P><FONT SIZE="5">Fantasy is a genre of speculative fiction which involves themes of the supernatural, magic, and imaginary
        worlds and creatures.Fantasy is distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the absence of scientific
        or macabre themes, although these can occur in fantasy. In popular culture, the fantasy genre predominantly features 
        settings that emulate Earth, but with a sense of otherness. In its broadest sense, however, fantasy consists of works 
        by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians from ancient myths and legends to many recent and popular works.</FONT></P>
