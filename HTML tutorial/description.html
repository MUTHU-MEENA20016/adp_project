     A geometric pattern is a kind of pattern formed of geometric shapes and typically repeated like a wallpaper design.In many areas of the decorative arts, from ceramics
     and textiles to wallpaper, "pattern" is used for an ornamental design that is manufactured, perhaps for many different shapes of object. In art and architecture,
     decorations or visual motifs may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer.
